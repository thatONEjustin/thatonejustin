Built with: `jekyll`

#### Todo
- [ ] Clean up JavaScript processing 
  - I'm kind of unsure of how github is processing the jekyll setu
    1. Can't check to see if github generates `/_site/`
    2. webpack mix is generating `/assets/js/index.js` so that `build exec jekyll serve` copies the file over for local development
- [ ] Figure out if I can escape the @ character for markdown rendered HTML (via Liquid)
  - Checked Liquid docs there's a `{{ content | replace (args) }}` possible solution
